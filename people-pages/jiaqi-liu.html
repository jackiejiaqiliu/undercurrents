                <h1>Jiaqi Liu</h1>
                <h2>Artist & Curator (PR & marketing - design / publication / research)</h2>
                <p>Jiaqi Liu (b.2001, Beijing, China) is a concept-driven project-based artist. Drawing inspiration from Eastern philosophy, mathematics, and the sciences, Jiaqi examines pattern, perception, the power of observation, and the tensions of communication in contemporary life. In her works, Jiaqi constructs precise conditions in which natural and cultural forces can unfold — valuing clarity of intent while leaving space for contingency, discovery, and reflection.<br><br>
                
                Jiaqi’s works have been exhibited internationally, including at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, US), Brooklyn Bridge Park (New York, US), AMC Empire Theater (New York, US), Microscope Gallery (New York, US), Czong Institute for Contemporary Art (Gimpo, KR), Jupiter Museum of Art (Shenzhen, CN), Galerie KUB (Leipzig, DE), as well as on large public screens in Denver (US), Kalamata (GR), and Rethymno (GR). Her works have been selected and featured by Tribeca Film Institute, Photoville Festival, The Wrong Biennale, BarTur Photo Award, Digerati Experimental Media Festival, Video Art Miden, among others. Jiaqi is currently finishing up her MFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with the Pritzker Fellowship and the Joan Truckenbrod Scholarship. Previously, she received a Dual-MS in Computer and Information Science from Cornell University with the Connective Media Fellowship, as well as a BFA <em>summa cum laude</em> with honors from NYU Tisch School of the Arts.</p>

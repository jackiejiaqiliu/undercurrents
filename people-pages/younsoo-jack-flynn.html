                <h1>Younsoo & Jack Flynn</h1>
                <h2>Artist</h2>
                <p><strong>Younsoo Kim Flynn</strong><br>
                    Younsoo Kim Flynn is a curator and arts administrator based in Chicago. Her work engages with material memory, cultural translation, and the evolving relationship between natural and built environments. She currently serves as Director of Employer Relations and Communications at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she earned her BFA in Curation and is pursuing a Master of Arts in Arts Administration and Policy (MAAAP).<br><br>
                    Kim Flynn’s curatorial and administrative practice spans more than fifteen years across galleries, museums, and academic institutions. Her projects include <em>home. </em>(SAIC Sullivan Galleries, 2008), <em>Breath</em> (Thomas Masters Gallery, 2009), and <em>Nature vs. Nurture</em> (Evanston Art Center, 2017). Through these exhibitions, she has explored themes of belonging, preservation, and transformation, emphasizing cross-cultural and ecological dialogues. Her recent research and writing examine the intersection of contemporary curatorial practice, institutional structures, and the sustainability of creative labor.<br><br>
                    <strong>Jack Flynn</strong><br>
                    Jack Flynn is an artist based in Chicago whose practice examines perception, structure, and spatial atmosphere through meticulous oil painting. His compositions merge the formal precision of design with a contemplative realism that situates abstract form within quiet, transitional spaces. In Flynn’s paintings, elemental forms of iron, stone, or ice function as architectural and narrative devices, evoking a sense of suspended time and stillness. His use of muted tonal contrasts and planar color fields invites reflection on the boundaries between the material and the metaphysical.<br><br>
                    Flynn’s work has been presented in numerous exhibitions, including <em>Shore Thing</em> (J Petter Galleries, Saugatuck, MI, 2025), <em>Artful Dwellings</em> (Chicago, 2024), <em>Tastefully Absurd</em> (Hairpin Arts, Chicago, 2023), and <em>Nature vs. Nurture</em> (Evanston Art Center, 2017). His paintings have been featured in American Art Magazine (2025), Luxe Chicago (2024, 2021, 2019), and Driftless Magazine (2018, 2015). Flynn received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Loyola University Chicago and pursued postgraduate studies in Graphic Design at Dominican University.</p>

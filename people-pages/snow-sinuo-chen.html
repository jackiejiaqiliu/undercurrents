                <h2>Artist & Curator (exhibition design / logistics)</h2>
                <p>Snow (Sinuo) Chen is a multimedia artist with a deep fascination for cultural rituals and the dynamics of social media platforms and communities. Her work engages with witchcraft, language, identity, and cyberspace, weaving art and technology to explore the relationship between the virtual and the real, while reactivating ancient narratives in contemporary resonance.<br><br>
                She is currently pursuing her MFA at the School of Art Institute of Chicago in department Art and Technology/Sound Practices. Her work has been performed and exhibited in art spaces, clubs and on public large screens across Chicago, New York, and Shanghai. </p>

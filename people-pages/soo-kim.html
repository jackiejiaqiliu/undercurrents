                <h2>Artist & Curator (logistics; exhibition design; PR & marketing)</h2>
                <p>Soo Kim is a curator, interactive sculptor, and arts administrator committed to creating inclusive and engaging art spaces. Born in South Korea, she works across diverse media, with clay as a primary material, to create interactive experiences that foster playful engagement. After attending Idyllwild Arts Academy in California, Soo pursued her BFA in Ceramics and Sculpture at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). Soo is now completing her Dual MA in Modern and Contemporary Art History & Arts Administration and Policy at SAIC. Kim currently works as a Graduate Curatorial Assistant at SAIC Galleries, assisting with thesis and specialty exhibitions. Her leadership in projects such as Road to Utopia: Threshold at the Korean Cultural Center of Chicago and her experience founding “object by soo” in Seoul demonstrate her ability to merge personal narratives with universal themes through art. Her administrative roles with Chicago local galleries have deepened her commitment to promoting cross-cultural dialogue, accessibility, and community engagement in the arts. Soo’s practice highlights the transformative potential of art to evoke joy, foster interaction, and promote understanding among diverse audiences. </p>

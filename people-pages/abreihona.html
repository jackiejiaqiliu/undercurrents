                <h2>Curator (writing & interpretation; publication; logistics)</h2>
                <p>abreihona is a Chicago-based arts administrator, art historian, curator, and museum educator whose work centers Black art and builds practical infrastructures for Black artists. A dual-MA candidate in Arts Administration and Policy & Modern and Contemporary Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), her research focuses on Black ontologies in popular and visual culture. Her interdisciplinary practice bridges research, curatorial strategy, interpretation, arts administration, and appraisal—linking scholarship to institutional decision-making and artist support. Professionally, she has contributed to museum education and interpretation at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA) and the Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA), conducted appraisal and valuation research at MIR Appraisal Services, and supported contemporary artists such as Tsedaye Makonnen. She translates critical inquiry into accessible forms—from exhibition texts and interpretive tours to public programs and collection writing—while advocating for equitable frameworks that sustain Black artistic production. Across roles, she advances rigorous, care-driven engagement with Black visual culture and the publics it gathers.</p>

                <h1>Rome Wareham</h1>
                <h2>Artist</h2>
                <p>Rome Wareham (b. 2004) is an interdisciplinary artist with a focus on sculpture. They primarily work with bronze and other metals. They have a background in many other mediums including carving, painting, drawing, animation, woodworking, and digital art, as well as others. Process and craftsmanship is very important in Rome’s work. They prefer to make as much of the work themselves, going as far as to manufacture their own drawing and painting materials as well as constructing their own ground by hand. Rome’s passion lies in creating above all else. Lately, their subject matter has been leaning in favor of whimsicality and surrealism. Currently, they are pursuing a BFA at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>

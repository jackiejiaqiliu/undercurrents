                <h2>Artist & Curator (exhibition design)</h2>
                <p>Beile Hu is an interdisciplinary artist and researcher of performance, sound, and moving images. Expanding to include the entangled relationships between trees, soil, and architecture within the urban ecology, their aim is to explore the potential of the human body as a sensor that can be transformed through soundscapes and its intimate interactions with non-human entities. Over the past few years, through the sonic and embodied fieldwork conducted in diverse urban centers across China and the United States. They suggest a way for people to establish more-than-human intimacy. Via the audio-visual performance and mixed media installations, they stress that technology can extend the embodied exploration of sensory interplay. Their work examines how these non-human entities retain, transform, and echo human presence—both physically and historically. By tracing the imprints left by urban life on these materials and the way they, in turn, shape human perception and memory, their practice reveals the porous boundaries between the built environment, organic matter, and the bodies that move through them.</p>

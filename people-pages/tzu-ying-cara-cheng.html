                <h1>Tzu Ying (Cara) Cheng</h1>
                <h2>Curator (PR & Marketing, Programming, Logistics)</h2>
                <p>Tzu Ying (Cara) Cheng is a curator and arts administrator pursuing a dual MA in Arts Administration & Policy and Modern and Contemporary Art History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. With a background in photography, her curatorial work explores East Asian identity, diaspora, gender, and the politics of representation. She approaches curating as cultural translation and ethical care, emphasizing collaboration and community engagement. Recent projects in Chicago, including Drown-Proofing at Epiphany Center for the Arts, highlight her commitment to amplifying underrepresented voices. As an international student, she brings a critical transnational perspective to cultural storytelling. Her photographic practice has been recognized internationally by Taipei Fashion Week, PhotoVogue, the Tokyo International Foto Awards, and NTUA’s Mediart Awards. She is currently developing curatorial strategies that center collective memory, process, and translocal solidarity.</p>

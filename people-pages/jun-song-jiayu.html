                <h1>Jun Song Jiayu</h1>
                <h2>Curator (publication / PR & marketing)</h2>
                <p>Jun Song Jiayu (宋佳宇) is a curator, photographer, screenwriter, and researcher currently based between Chicago and East Asia. With a background in both fine arts and film theory, his curatorial approach often emerges at the intersection of visual storytelling, media translation, and critical reflection.<br><br>
                Jun has previously worked on film-related exhibitions and served as editor for multiple art magazines, where he shaped discursive spaces around moving images and contemporary visual culture. His artistic practice revolves around photography and writing for film—mediums through which he probes the peculiar distance between people, the quiet tension between presence and absence. These concerns also extend into his academic research, which focuses on the creative and theoretical possibilities of intermedial film adaptation—particularly how narratives mutate when traveling across formats.<br><br>
                For this exhibition in Venice, Jun is in charge of public relations and publication, roles through which he rethinks how curatorial language and communication shape the reception of artworks. His interest lies not only in what is shown, but how it is spoken about—how images circulate, are framed, and ultimately remembered. He believes that curation is not merely about selection, but also about composing a rhythm between works, spaces, and the viewers’ movement through them.</p>

                <h1>Younsoo Kim Flynn</h1>
                <h2>Curator (PR & marketing / logistics / exhibition design)</h2>
                <p>Younsoo Kim Flynn is a curator and arts administrator based in Chicago. Her work engages with material memory, cultural translation, and the evolving relationship between natural and built environments. She currently serves as Director of Employer Relations and Communications at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she earned her BFA in Curation and is pursuing a Master of Arts in Arts Administration and Policy (MAAAP).<br><br>
                
                Kim Flynn’s curatorial and administrative practice spans more than fifteen years across galleries, museums, and academic institutions. Her projects include <em>home. </em>(SAIC Sullivan Galleries, 2008), <em>Breath</em> (Thomas Masters Gallery, 2009), and <em>Nature vs. Nurture</em> (Evanston Art Center, 2017). Through these exhibitions, she has explored themes of belonging, preservation, and transformation, emphasizing cross-cultural and ecological dialogues. Her recent research and writing examine the intersection of contemporary curatorial practice, institutional structures, and the sustainability of creative labor.</p>
